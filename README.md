Responsible AI considerations

A reference list with links to the references you have used, and any additional resources relevant to this topic. The reference list should include at least one relevant research paper (not news articles, medium, blog, library documentation, or LinkedIn posts) that is high quality, less than 3 years old, and from one of the research sources listed below. Note that if a project topic lists specific paper(s), they must be included and presented.


(2) A well-documented code file that you can run to demo your project. This can be a .py file, a Jupyter Notebook, or a link to a Colab. Make sure you can run the code during the presentation for a demo. You can demo code examples found on the internet, but you must cite the source.


(3) A link to an externally hosted website (e.g. a Google App Script site, a Google Sheets site) that you have built using GenAI (e.g. Claude) to demonstrate a simple idea related to your topic. If this is not possible for your topic, you can instead demo of the use of a well-chosen product.


(4) A project page for your group with a kanban board that looks like this that show a list of tasks that you have done, ongoing, and potential future development ideas as to-dos. Your team should use the project page during the semester to track your tasks and progress. You should be ready to discuss how you used the project board during your presentation.
